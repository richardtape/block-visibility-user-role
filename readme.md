# Content Visibility User Role Add-On

Need to show one or more blocks on your page (or post) to only your editors but want to keep the rest of the content public? This add-on for the [Content Visibility WordPress plugin](https://github.com/richardtape/content-visibility) allows you to do exactly that.

## Examples

Show one version of a block for the public and another for your site's subscribers

or

Only show a block to those signed in as Authors

or

Leave yourself a note (paragraph block for example) at the top of the page that only you, as an admin, can see.

## Content Visibility

Works alongside the core [Content Visibility plugin](https://github.com/richardtape/content-visibility) and [Date and Time add-on](https://github.com/richardtape/content-visibility-date-and-time) meaning you can schedule blocks for dates and times and only shown them to those users signed in with a specific role.
