A user roles add-on for [Content Visibility](https://wordpress.org/plugins/content-visibility/).

== Description ==

Need to show a content block to only your site's authors? Or maybe just to admins only? The User Roles add-on for [Content Visbility](https://wordpress.org/plugins/content-visibility/) allows you to do just that!

Every block on your site (including widgets) can be shown or hidden to users who have any role (or roles).

## Custom Roles
This add-on supports any custom role that your theme or plugins have registered, as well as the native WordPress roles.

## Development

Development is mostly done on [github](https://github.com/richardtape/content-visibility-user-role/issues/new) and releases are made there and here to the WordPress plugins directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's with the logo? =

It's a chameleon. A cool little creature which can change the way it appears - to make itself more or less visible. Seemed appropriate! Also, your suspicions are correct; a designer, I am not.
